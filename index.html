      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a dabbler. I like to know a little about a lot; some have called me Jake of All Trades.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've spent my whole memorable life in Auburn. I was born in Bremerton, but I moved to Auburn before starting school and have been here ever since.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love music and have been singing in choirs for about a decade. I've been playing guitar and ukulele nearly as long, and I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons nearly as long as that! I also love playing video games like WoW, Overwatch, and Skyrim.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have so many varied interests, it's hard to choose! I'd really love to be a game developer, though I'm certain I'd be equally as happy doing that as a hobby alongside some programming job related to aerospace or robotics.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in my parents' house in Auburn, which was my grandparents' house for almost my whole life prior.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is a skill that is only becoming more universally useful with each passing year. I love design, so front-end web development is fun, but I also love getting into the deeper workings of the system and how it accomplishes the amazing things we can make computers and phones do these days.</p>
      <p><em>No matter what I choose to do or how I choose to program, web development is sure to be an intrinsic part of it.</em></p>
